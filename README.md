# CanonChecker Server

This repository contains the server-side code for CanonChecker. It handles backend logic, API endpoints, and data management for the application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:  
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

To set yourself up for testing and run the server through GitHub Codespaces...

1. Open GitHub Codespaces, organic meme

https://github.com/codespaces/organic-meme-gwj6w6j77v4c9qwr

2. From that instance, run 
```
npm run devStart
```

3. Set the port opened afterwards to public

Any other application, like the client side, should then be able to access the server.
